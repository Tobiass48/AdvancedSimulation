### Purpose:

The data and the model are created for Assignment 2 in the course EPA133a - Advanced Simulation TU Delft.

### Infomration:

The attached code and data can model the N1 road from Bangladesh. The model aims to examine the vulnerability and criticality of bridges on the N1 and the effects of broken bridges on the traffic flow of trucks on the N1. The code is written and tested for Python 3.11.8. The specific packages used are given in the requirement.txt file. To use the code an environment for Python should be created and the packages stated in the requirements.txt should be installed. 

### Purpose code files

Various Python files are included. Each has its purpose which will be briefly explained in the Table underneath.

| File                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| components.py        | Contains the used classes for the model, except the model class itself                                                                          |
| model.py             | Contains the model class which can use the components.py file in combination with the data produced by data.py and links.py to simulate the N1. |
| model_run.py         | Runs the model.py. Used to get the data per scenario.                                                                                           |
| visualize_results.py | Visualize the data per scenario from model_run.py                                                                                               |
| model_viz.py         | Runs the model.py and creates a visualisation of the model results in a separate window.                                                        |

### File structuring

The folder has a specific structure that is as follows:

    EPA133a-G04-A2/
        ├── data/
        ├── experiment/
        ├── img/
        ├── model/
        └── report/

The data folder contains the data files needed and produced by the .py files and should look like:

    data/
     ├── cleaned_data/
     │   └── infrastructure/
     │         └── BMMS_overview.xlsx
     │         └── _roads3.csv
     │         └── roads_for_model.csv
     ├── demo-1.csv
     ├── demo-2.csv
     └── demo-3.csv

The experiment folder contains the scenario results in CSV-format and should look like:

    experiment/
     ├── scenario0.csv
     ├── scenario1.csv
     ├── scenario2.csv
     ├── scenario3.csv
     ├── scenario4.csv
     ├── scenario5.csv
     ├── scenario6.csv
     ├── scenario7.csv
     └── scenario8.csv

The image folder contains all the images generated by the visualize_results.py. These images show and compare the scenario results and should look like: 

    img/
     └── output.png

The model folder contains all the code files required to run the model and should look like this:

    model/
        ├── ContinuousSpace/
        │   └── SimpleContinuousModule.py
        ├── components.py
        ├── model.py
        ├── model_run.py
        ├── model_viz.py
        └── visualize_results.py

Lastly, the report folder contains the report that provides detailed information on the analysis conducted for the Bangladesh case. 

    report/
     └── Assignment_2__Group4.pdf


The cleaned and final file that we used is the roads_for_model.csv. 

The results of this Assignment can be seen in the report.
